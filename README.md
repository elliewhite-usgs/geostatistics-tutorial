See the results in Tutorial.html or Tutorial.pdf.
The code is included in Tutorial.rmd file.
airqual.csv has the ozone data used in the Tutorial.
Counties includes California county shapefiles for plotting purposes.
The Papers folder includes some papers found online for further reading.

Further Improvements Needed:
include spatio-temporal kriging in the analysis
apply the transision probability markov chain analysis to a better dataset
